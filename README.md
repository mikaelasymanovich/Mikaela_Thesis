I (Matt) added the HINT+HI2014, iRefIndex14, and ReactomeFI 2015 protein-protein interaction networks.  Our group processed each of these networks, creating undirected, unweighted, and connected graphs.  I saved them as edge lists, where each line of each file (`hint+hi2014.tsv`, `irefindex14.tsv`, `reactomefi2015.tsv`) corresponds to an edge in the graph.
